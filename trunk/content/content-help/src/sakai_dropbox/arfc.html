<h2>Drop Box: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Drop Box feature allows instructors and students to share
documents within a private folder for each student. The Drop Box works
like Resources to allow you to upload many types of files and many
files at a time. The Drop Box also allows nested folders (folders
within folders).</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Progress reports:</strong> Instructors can use the Drop Box
tool to provide private progress reports to each student in the class.</p>

<p><strong>Adding participants:</strong> When you add participants or
students to a worksite, either automatically or manually, they will
have Drop Box folders by default (if the Drop Box tool was specified
when the site was first created).</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>A new Drop Box item will automatically go into the folder that you
have open when you create the item.  <br /><br /> 
</li><li>With the exception of plain text and HTML documents, the Revise
option only allows you to revise the information about a Drop Box item,
such as its name, description, or copyright information. You cannot
revise the contents of a document or file within a Drop Box.<br /><br />
</li><li>Whenever you add an item to the Drop Box, you have the option of
sending email notification.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Make sure you know the laws and policies regarding the use of
copyrighted material.
