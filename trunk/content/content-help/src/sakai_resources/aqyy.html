<h2>WebDAV</h2><h3>What it does</h3>

<p>WebDAV is a technology that allows you to easily
transfer files and folders from your local computer to your Resources
folder in your <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> or a course site or project
site to which you belong. WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed
Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the
HTTP protocol that allows users to collaboratively edit and
manage files on remote web servers.</p>

<p>Once you have set up WebDAV, your computer will treat your
Resources section like any other folder on your local system. You will
be able to drag and drop files and folders from Resources just as you
would in My Computer in Windows XP or the Finder
on a Mac.</p>

<p>For more information about WebDAV, including technical specifications
and major features, see the WebDAV FAQ at:</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Locking properties:</strong> If you are using WebDAV to
work on files and folders in a shared Resources section, you can use
its locking properties to prevent two or more users from overwriting
the same resource without first merging changes.</p>


<p><strong>Windows vs. Mac:</strong> On a Windows XP computer, WebDAV
works through My Network Places. Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)
supports secure WebDAV connections. If you use Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther)
or earlier, you will need to download software called Goliath if you
want to use WebDAV.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>There must be at least one object (i.e., file or folder) in your
Resources section before you set up WebDAV.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you are using WebDAV in Windows and have mapped a drive to the
application  via Network Places, you cannot delete a
file by dragging it from the Network Place window to the Recycle
Bin. Instead, select the file and click <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.  

<br /><br />
</li><li>WebDAV will require you to enter the siteID for each site you wish
to access. The siteID is a unique identifier for each worksite. To
find the siteID, in the worksite's menubar, click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong>.
Click <strong><code>Manage/Download Multiple Resources</code></strong>. Scroll down to the
"Your SiteID" section for the siteID.
